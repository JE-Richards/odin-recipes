# Recipe Blog: An Introductory HTML Project

## Overview

This is my attempt to complete the introductory HTML project laid out in the Foundations Course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The aim of the project is to utilise basic HTML knowledge, built up across earlier segments of the course, to construct a simple website. 

The website contains
- A simple homepage
- Three separate recipe pages

As the course progresses, CSS is introduced. To practice basic CSS, this project will be revisited and updated to include basic CSS stylesheets that will influence the look of our basic HTML pages.

## The Website

To view the website in your browser, please visit [https://je-richards.github.io/odin-recipes/](https://je-richards.github.io/odin-recipes/).
